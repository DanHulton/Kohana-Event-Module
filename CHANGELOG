0.1.1
-----------------------------------
- Revised codebase to fit a better 80 margin ... was it needed?
- Removed all current UnitTests as they need to be rewritten to follow new structure
- All classes, functions are under the "prggmr" namespace.
- Removed the DataInstance class as it was redundant and served no real purpose.
- All functions and classes now fall under the "prggmr" namespace only.
- Added param (stateCheck) to Event::executeChain allowing the Event state check to be skipped.
- Renamed Event::triggerChain to Event::executeChain
- Renamed all listen and trigger method to subscribe and bubble throughout the entire codebase.
- Event chain is now automatically executed before an event bubbles.
- Event object chain (_parent) is now refered to as (_chain) for simplicity.
- Refactored event chaining to allow the chain to be set dynamically rather than in the constructor.
- Removed Event constructor parameter for parent event.
- Moved all source into a single file.
- Added the bubble, analyze and subscribe functions.
- Changed Event state constants to 0xCF60 (active), 0x5250 (inactive), 0x2F4B (error)
- Added AdapterInterface interface
- Removed all logic code from adapter, adapter now acts only as an interface to the engine.
- Renamed Listenable class to Adapter
- Renamed prggmr class to engine.
- Added support for simplified regex events e.g. "hello/:world" rather than "hello/(?P<world>[a-z0-9_-]+)"
