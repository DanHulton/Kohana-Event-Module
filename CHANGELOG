- Event benchmarks are now stored by the subscription and index by the subscriber name
- Removed the library and loader class as they add to much bulk and be easily be added outside
- Added stackResults option to bubble method
- Removed flags option in bubble method to allow for engine level stacking config
- Event object is no longer a child of Adapter
- Revised codebase to fit a better 80 margin ... was it needed?
- Removed all current UnitTests as they need to be rewritten to follow new structure
- All classes, functions are under the "prggmr" namespace.
- Removed the DataInstance class as it was redundant and served no real purpose.
- Added param (stateCheck) to Event::executeChain allowing the Event state check to be skipped.
- Renamed Event::triggerChain to Event::executeChain
- Renamed all listen and trigger method to subscribe and bubble throughout the entire codebase.
- Event chain is now automatically executed before an event bubbles.
- Event object chain (_parent) is now refered to as (_chain) for simplicity.

- Removed Event constructor parameter for parent event.
- Refactored the directory structure to complement the modified/removed code.
- Added the bubble, analyze and subscribe functions.
- Changed Event state constants to 0x01 (active), 0x02 (inactive), 0x03 (error)
- Added AdapterInterface interface
- Removed all logic code from adapter, adapter now acts only as an interface to the engine.
