## Introduction ##
A brief summarization of what prggmr is:

> PHP frameworks have been slowly evolving since their debut in the early 2000's, since that time their have been
> countless frameworks released for PHP which all follow the basic architecture of the MVC ( Model-View-Controller )
> and besides feature introductions and speed enchancements not much has changed. This is where Prggmr steps in, Prggmr is
> a completely new spin on PHP framework architecture as it introduces the EMV ( Event-Model-View ) which replaces the
> Controllers with an entirely event driven system.
